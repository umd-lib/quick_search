# QuickSearch

**Note:** This is a forked version of the NCSU QuickSearch application. See
[README-UMD.md](README-UMD.md) for changes.

> Note: This code has recently been converted to a Rails Gem Engine. It is encouraged that you use this version, but if you are
> looking for the original release of QuickSearch as a standalone Rails project, it can be found here:

QuickSearch is a customized federated search tool designed to connect people to a variety of library resources, services, and tools. QuickSearch is designed to complement and increase use of existing dedicated library resource discovery tools, such as the catalog, electronic resource search, and subject guides/portals, by directing people to them via an intuitive search interface. The aim of QuickSearch is to provide people with a quick and easy way to find the information they need.

## Disclaimer

This code has been extracted from the code we have been running in

## Installation

The aim of QuickSearch is to make it very easy to get up and running.

Follow these instructions to install QuickSearch for
development.

#### Prerequisites

- Rails 5.0
- Ruby 2.2.2+ or 2.3.x
- MySQL development headers (mysql-devel package on CentOS, libmysqlclient-dev on Ubuntu)
- qtwebkit development headers (qtwebkit-devel package on CentOS, libqtwebkit-dev on Ubuntu)

#### Instructions

##### Create a new Rails app, cd into the directory:

    rails new my_app

    ...

    cd my_app

##### Add quick_search-core gem to your Gemfile:

    gem 'quick_search-core'

> For development, use: gem 'quick_search-core', git: 'git://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/quick_search.git'

##### Run 'bundle install'

##### Run the QuickSearch installation generator:

    bundle exec rails generate quick_search:install

The generator will install the generic QuickSearch theme, and some
searchers that will work out of the box. For more information on further
